### Notes on Classes, Objects, and Constructors in Java

#### Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In Java, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects" and "classes." It allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions.

#### 1. Classes
A **class** in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class can have.

**Real-Life Example: Car Class**

Think of a `Car` as a class. A car has properties like `color`, `brand`, `model`, and `year`, and behaviors like `start()`, `stop()`, and `accelerate()`.

```java
class Car {
    // Attributes or properties of a car
    String color;
    String brand;
    int year;
    String model;
    
    // Constructor - Initializes the object when created
    Car(String c, String b, int y, String m) {
        color = c;
        brand = b;
        year = y;
        model = m;
    }

    // Methods or behaviors of a car
    void start() {
        System.out.println(brand + " " + model + " is starting.");
    }

    void stop() {
        System.out.println(brand + " " + model + " is stopping.");
    }

    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println(brand + " " + model + " is accelerating.");
    }
}
```

#### 2. Objects
An **object** is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from that class. An object represents a specific instance of the class with its own set of values for the properties defined by the class.

**Real-Life Example: Creating a Car Object**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota", 2022, "Corolla");

        // Accessing the object's methods
        myCar.start();  // Output: Toyota Corolla is starting.
        myCar.accelerate();  // Output: Toyota Corolla is accelerating.
        myCar.stop();  // Output: Toyota Corolla is stopping.
    }
}
```

In this example, `myCar` is an **object** of the `Car` class. When we create `myCar`, we use the `new` keyword and call the constructor of the `Car` class.

#### 3. Constructors
A **constructor** in Java is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the newly created object. The constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

**Types of Constructors:**
1. **Default Constructor**: If no constructor is defined in a class, Java provides a default constructor.
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: A constructor that accepts parameters to initialize the object with specific values.

**Example of Parameterized Constructor:**

In the `Car` class above, `Car(String c, String b, int y, String m)` is a parameterized constructor. It takes four parameters to initialize the properties of the `Car` object.

#### Real-Life Example: Bank Account Class

Imagine a `BankAccount` class where each account has attributes like `accountNumber`, `accountHolderName`, and `balance`, and behaviors like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.

```java
class BankAccount {
    // Attributes of a bank account
    String accountNumber;
    String accountHolderName;
    double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize the bank account
    BankAccount(String accNumber, String accHolderName, double initialBalance) {
        accountNumber = accNumber;
        accountHolderName = accHolderName;
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println(amount + " deposited. New balance: " + balance);
    }

    // Method to withdraw money
    void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println(amount + " withdrawn. New balance: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance!");
        }
    }
}
```

**Creating and Using a BankAccount Object:**

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of BankAccount class
        BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe", 5000.0);

        // Accessing object's methods
        myAccount.deposit(1500.0);  // Output: 1500.0 deposited. New balance: 6500.0
        myAccount.withdraw(2000.0);  // Output: 2000.0 withdrawn. New balance: 4500.0
        myAccount.withdraw(5000.0);  // Output: Insufficient balance!
    }
}
```

#### Conclusion
Classes, objects, and constructors form the foundation of object-oriented programming in Java. They allow developers to model real-world entities and behaviors in a structured and reusable way. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing robust and scalable Java applications.
